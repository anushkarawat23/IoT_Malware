# IoT_Malware

The exponential increase in the use of smart devices has also increased the possibility of malware in the dataset. To protect the data from cyber-attacks and malware, it is important to differentiate between legitimate and malicious data. Thus, this study emphasizes the significance of protecting smart devices from attacks and offers various machine-learning methods for identifying and categorizing 
malware. 

In the project, different machine learning algorithms are proposed to detect and classify IoT malware from the MQTT dataset, a standard protocol for IoT messaging.

The different machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, CNN, Gradient Boost, Light GBM, and Naive Bayes are proposed and compared based on their accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

The Random Forest technique came out to be the most effective technique as it has the greatest accuracy percentage and F1 score.
